Well, you're in the right place. Hello and welcome to It's the Economy, a new podcast series brought to you by Intelligent Squared. I'm Nicola Walton, and I'm not an economist, but I do think it's important that economics is accessible. The economy impacts every aspect of our lives, from how we work to where we live. But how much do we really understand about how big economic concepts and decisions affect us? In this podcast, I'll be breaking down complex economic ideas, so in the time it takes to have a cup of coffee, you'll understand what they mean and why they matter to us. In each episode, I'll be joined by an economics expert to talk us through it all. This week, we're looking at the green economy, and my guest is Anne Pettyfer, a British economist who's perhaps best known for correctly predicting the financial crisis of 2007. Her current work focuses on the global financial system and sustainable development. Welcome to the podcast, Anne. Thank you very much, Nicola. Happy to be here. Well, let's start with some definitions. What do we actually mean by a green economy? I think a green economy is a sustainable one, one that lives within the ecosystem's limits, if you like. And so that has to be one which recognises the finite nature of the resources that we use and therefore adjusts our activity, our economic activity, to those limits. And are there specific sectors within that economy that we sort of recognise? Yes. I mean, the economy is divided up into the monetary system, the fiscal system, if you like. The real economic system where economic activity takes place. And essential to all of that is the monetary system. The monetary system is our system of money, our system of issuing credit, and our system, if you like, of managing money, money flows and credit, both at the level of the public sector but also the private sector. And unless we \u2013 my argument is that unless we manage the monetary system, the issuance of credit, it will not be possible to manage consumption and production. And consumption and production has to be managed to fit within the limits of the ecosystem. So you've written about the Green New Deal. Tell me more about that. The Green New Deal is about transforming the global economy but also our domestic economy in such a way as to make the environment sustainable for all of us, in such a way as to make it possible for the planet to survive, the degree to the extent to which we've already overwarmed it, if you like. So the Green New Deal understands that the economy and the ecosystem are structurally bound together and that if we want to save the world, we have to begin by changing the economy in order to be able to protect the ecosystem. Well, the United Nations Environmental Programme argues that to be green, an economy must not only be efficient but also fair. Do you think that's achievable? Oh, absolutely. I think the way our economy is currently structured is to be unfair. It's structured to benefit, if you like, the 1%. The deregulation of the monetary system, the deregulation of the financial system, the removal, if you like, of public authority over the system into the hands of private authority, moving from the government, if you like, to the City of London or Wall Street. All of those have made the economy very unfair because Wall Street, of course, and the City of London had the interest of their market participants, shareholders, if you like, the head of the queue. On the other hand, those who have to work by hand or brain, if you like, have found their wages falling in real terms or being stagnant. And it's that divide between the owners of assets and the workers, the owners of labour, on the other hand, which has been made much worse under the current system and led to massive inequality. And we can change that. This is a system that was designed by economists, by human beings, and it can be redesigned. And do you think the political will is there though now? I think that is beginning to happen. It's extraordinary what is happening in the United States right now, where Joe Biden, for example, is arguing that it wasn't wealth that built America, but it was workers, what he calls the middle class, that built America. And he's proposed a new approach to the economy based on what he calls full employment. Now, people think we do already have full employment, but in fact, we don't. We have precarious employment, low paid employment and part time employment, large swathes of part time insecure employment. And he's beginning to argue that, no, we've got to alter that balance of power between workers and employers. We've got to have a full employment policy, which gives workers greater power relative to their employers. That is a sea change. That is a dramatic paradigm shift. It all sounds very revolutionary. So if we have a complete change in favour of workers and also the environment, can the world economy still prosper? Nicola, it really isn't revolutionary. It's pretty damn mainstream. It's pretty damn mainstream that everyone should enjoy the fruits of the economy. We think it's radical because it's so different from the way things are at the moment. But yes, of course, the economy can prosper. One of the problems with having one percent earning enormous sums of money, which they don't spend and they don't invest because the one percent tend on the whole not to do that, while the 99 percent earn very little and don't spend and don't invest or save their money because they've got to just use it to live on. That means the economy as the whole is suffering from what economists call under consumption. Now, many a green economist thinks that under consumption is a good thing. But it really means that we can't afford our own product. We can't afford the things we make ourselves. And as a result, economies are oriented towards exports. And that distorts the global economy as well, because the global economy now is very heavily oriented towards exporting. And the companies that export are the one percent. They're the ones that are doing really well. If we reorient the economy so that there's more domestic economic activity that does two things, it means that more people are able to participate in the economy and to gain from the economy. And that benefits everybody, as Biden said in a recent speech. But it also means that we're not engaged in a process where we're all trying to out compete each other at a global level by exporting more than somebody else. In terms of greening the economy, some economists have argued that the way forward is to give a value to things like carbon, which is now leading to carbon trading. Is that an effective way, do you think, to reduce environmental risk? I personally don't think so. It's a form of taxation. And it's based on the attitude that we have a massive problem and everybody is responsible for it. And that is not true. Whereas my approach is that governments should, in the first instance, provide alternative systems, more sustainable systems, before we decide to tax people for the use of carbon. But the second point I want to make is that 50 percent of toxic emissions are generated by the top 10 percent. And the top one percent generates a lot more than do most ordinary people in Africa, in Europe, in Latin America. And by punishing all of us in Africa, Europe and Latin America and leaving the one percent or the 10 percent to carry on, for example, flying to conferences on climate change in their private jets, we're really not going to tackle the problem. Each week we look at a historical example of this episode's theme. Today it's the green economy. While some countries still prefer to rely on their own resource rich supplies of oil and gas for energy or import fuel, others have turned to the relatively new technology of renewable energy. My producer, Lovejeet Dhaliwal, takes a look at what Tunisia has been up to and how it's been embracing the concept of a greener economy. Over 15 years ago Tunisia decided to invest seriously in clean energy and set up a fund to help increase the use of renewable energy technologies. In just three years, from 2005 to 2008, Tunisia's government managed to save $1.1 billion in energy bills. A pretty good return on an initial investment of $200 million. In 2009, the government unveiled a national solar energy plan allowing to increase its use of energy from renewable resources. The solar plan includes the use of solar panels, which captures energy from the sun, transforming it into electricity, solar water heating systems, as well as solar power units for generating electricity. The energy savings from the solar energy plan alone, over a seven year period, is thought to be in the region of just over 20%. And here's another statistic. Tunisia managed to reduce the amount of CO2 it admits by 1.3 million tonnes a year. The investment in this green area has also boosted the economy with job growth and reducing the country's dependency on fuel imports. And that's not all. Although 97% of Tunisia's power supplies from conventional power, the government aims to generate 30% of power from renewable sources by 2030. So Anne, do you think 30% is an achievable target for Tunisia? Whether or not it's achievable, this is absolutely imperative. Scientists are beginning to tell us that we are already way beyond the level of emissions that will keep the global temperature below 1.5 degrees. A planet that warms by 2 degrees centigrade will not be a livable planet. And so whatever we may think, to live within the scientific guidelines being offered to us at the moment requires a kind of urgency that makes it necessary for Tunisia, for example, to think of even a bigger cut in emissions by 2030. And with the rising population, 3 billion more middle class consumers are expected by 2030. There'll be greater demand for resources. So how can we prepare for that? By cutting our rates of consumption. And I speak again about the top 10%. The top 10% expect to achieve levels of consumption that are unheard of in historic terms. You know, we expect to have every possible gadget. We expect to renew those gadgets every year. So I'm arguing a Green New Deal is going to mean, if you like, a more sustainable way of living, which means a simpler way of living and as a way of living, which I define as growing our own green beans. You know, we currently expect to have green beans on our dinner plates almost every day of the year for 365 days a year. We expect people in Kenya on low wages to draw on Kenya's water table to grow green beans and then to put them in an airplane and fly them to us on a daily basis. That is a level of consumption that has to change. We have to learn to become more self-sufficient. You know, we've got to have slow levels of consumption that is going to require radical change in the way we live and a much simpler way in the way we live. Stat of the Week. Now it's time for our Stat of the Week. Each week we'll be bringing you a figure that's often quoted in the press and seen as a key indicator of the health of the overall economy. This week we're looking at the global green growth, which before the pandemic was estimated to be $7.87 trillion. How significant do you think this figure is? I think it's really quite insignificant. If you think that annual income, the global income is about $87 trillion, this is a tiny proportion of our annual income that we're devoting towards green activity. We have to up that number quite dramatically. And global green growth, what does that actually mean? What does that encompass? Well, again, you know, we're in the realm of language here. Green growth implies that we can go on expanding economic activity ad infinitum. So we've got to end the concept of green growth. We've got to talk much more about sustainable activity. That was Stat of the Week. And this week we were looking at global green growth. If things like renewable energy and environmental protection and low carbon goods and services are growing in terms of demand and there's new products coming from financial markets in the sort of green area, isn't that a sort of a good way of boosting the economy overall? I'm someone who believes that for the economy to be sustainable, it has to be a full employment economy. And what that means is that what we do by human labor does not necessarily result in greenhouse gas emissions. And therefore it's better for us to undertake labor intensive activity than fossil fuel intensive activities. So if we're going to have more labor intensive activities, which are not emitting greenhouse gas emissions, that's sustainable. If we're going to get out of our cars and onto our bicycles and use our own labor to move, that is more sustainable activity. If we have more of that kind of activity, that's OK. But you don't sound too optimistic about the immediate future. I am quite pessimistic because, you know, as I say, emissions are still rising, the temperature is still rising, the Arctic is still melting. So we're seeing these extreme weather events take place, but we're still not acting radically enough and fast enough to ensure that we keep temperatures well below 1.5 degrees centigrade.

Joe Biden's proposed full employment policy aims to address this inequality and shift power to workers.\nArgument Against Key Idea 1: The current economic structure favors the 1% and leads to underconsumption, as the majority of people cannot afford the products they produce. Reorienting the economy towards more domestic economic activity can benefit everyone and reduce the need for export-oriented economies.\nSpecific Examples in Support of Argument Against Key Idea 1: Tunisia's investment in renewable energy has led to energy savings and job growth, showcasing the potential for a greener economy.\n\nTitle of Key Idea 2: The Green New Deal\nKey Idea 2: The Green New Deal aims to transform the global economy to make it sustainable and protect the ecosystem.\nArgument For Key Idea 2: The economy and the ecosystem are structurally bound together, and changing the economy is essential to protect the environment. Historically, the economy has been structured to benefit the wealthy, and it is time to shift power to workers and create a fairer economy.\nSpecific Examples in Support of Argument For Key Idea 2: Joe Biden's proposal of a new approach to the economy based on full employment is a significant paradigm shift, redistributing power between workers and employers. This change can lead to a more sustainable and prosperous economy.\nArgument Against Key Idea 2: A focus on green growth and investment in renewable energy can boost the overall economy and create jobs. It is not necessary to make radical changes in consumption or lifestyle to achieve sustainability.\nSpecific Examples in Support of Argument Against Key Idea 2: Tunisia's investment in clean energy has resulted in energy savings, reduced CO2 emissions, and boosted the economy with job growth.\n\nTitle of Key Idea 3: Taxation and Carbon Trading in Green Economy\nKey Idea 3: The value of carbon and carbon trading is a form of taxation that aims to reduce environmental risks.\nArgument For Key Idea 3: Governments should provide alternative, sustainable systems before taxing people for carbon use. Additionally, large emissions are generated by the top 10%, and punishing everyone for their emissions is not an effective solution.\nSpecific Examples in Support of Argument For Key Idea 3: The focus should be on reducing rates of consumption and transitioning to a simpler lifestyle. This requires changing the way we live and becoming more self-sufficient.\nArgument Against Key Idea 3: Giving a value to carbon and implementing carbon trading can incentivize companies and individuals to reduce their emissions and invest in greener alternatives. It can contribute to a more sustainable future.\nSpecific Examples in Support of Argument Against Key Idea 3: Tunisia's investment in renewable energy and reduction of CO2 emissions showcases the positive impact of embracing a greener economy.\n\n(Note: This is only Step 1 of the process, summarizing the key ideas and arguments from the podcast transcript. The next steps involve creating engaging Platonic dialogues based on these ideas.)", "podcast_guest": {"name": "Anne Pettyfer", "org": "", "title": "", "summary": "Not available"}, "podcast_highlights": "Philosophical Highlight 1: What John Stuart Mill would think about this podcast's discussion\n\nJohn Stuart Mill, a famous utilitarian philosopher, would appreciate the podcast's attempt to make economics more accessible and understandable to a wide audience. Mill believed in the importance of knowledge and education for the betterment of society, and this podcast's goal aligns with that belief. Mill would also likely support the emphasis on sustainability and economic fairness discussed in the podcast, as he advocated for policies that promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people.\n\nPhilosophical Highlight 2: What Karl Marx would think about this podcast's discussion\n\nKarl Marx, a key figure in Marxist philosophy, would see the podcast's focus on inequality and the need for systemic change as deeply relevant. Marx believed that the capitalist system inherently leads to class divisions and economic injustices. He would appreciate the podcast's critique of the current economic structure and the call for a more equitable distribution of wealth and resources. However, Marx might also be skeptical of the proposed Green New Deal, as he believed that fundamental change requires a complete overhaul of the capitalist system rather than mere reform.\n\nPhilosophical Highlight 3: What Adam Smith would think about this podcast's discussion\n\nAdam Smith, the father of modern economics and author of \"The Wealth of Nations,\" would appreciate the podcast's exploration of economic concepts and their impact on everyday life. Smith emphasized the importance of free markets and individual self-interest in driving economic prosperity. While some of the podcast's ideas, such as the call for greater government intervention and regulation, may not align with Smith's laissez-faire ideology, he would likely find value in the discussion of sustainable development and the potential for economic growth within ethical boundaries.\n\nPhilosophical Highlight 4: What John Maynard Keynes would think about this podcast's discussion\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes, an influential economist known for his theories on government intervention during economic downturns, would likely support the podcast's emphasis on the role of government in managing the monetary system and promoting economic stability. Keynes advocated for fiscal and monetary policies that prioritize full employment and economic growth. He would likely appreciate the discussion of a Green New Deal and the potential for job creation and sustainable development that it presents.\n\nPhilosophical Highlight 5: What David Hume would think about this podcast's discussion\n\nDavid Hume, a Scottish philosopher known for his empiricism and skepticism, would find value in the podcast's exploration of economic ideas and their impact on society. Hume emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and questioned the existence of absolute truths. He would likely appreciate the podcast's attempt to break down complex economic concepts and encourage critical thinking about their consequences. However, Hume might also caution against overly ambitious policy proposals without sufficient evidence of their effectiveness."}
